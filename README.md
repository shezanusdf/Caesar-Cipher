# Caesar Cipher Web App

## 1. Overview
A Roman-style Streamlit application that encodes and decodes text using the classical Caesar Cipher. The interface uses parchment colors and traditional typography inspired by ancient Rome.

## 2. Features
- Encode and decode messages with a shift key from 0 to 25  
- Preserves uppercase, lowercase, numbers, spaces, and punctuation  
- Elegant classical user interface styling  
- Instant transformation of user input  
- Simple and intuitive controls  

## 3. How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.  
Example with shift 3: A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on.  
The process wraps around the alphabet automatically.
